1. The FullApp.py file can run as long as you have the required files alongside it (embed folder, vectordb folder, Dogrun2.Pth). if there is no Hugging Face Text Generation Model compatible model present, the script will pull the recommended model, HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-1.7B. Making sure you have the necessary installations, which can be found in therequirements.txt plus any version of torch and torchvision, you can run the app on a terminal using Uvicorn, specifically uvicorn FullApp:app --reload. Then follow the address provided wg43g3g34g45hg34g

2. Everything in this folder is sufficient to recreate the docker image. However, you will need to pull a compatible Hugging Face Text Generation model and mount the folder to the built container, recommended model mentioned above. THE BEST WAY TO RUN THIS APP IS TO SIMPLY PULL THE IMAGE FROM MY DOCKERHUB.
