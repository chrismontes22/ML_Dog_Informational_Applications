**Welcome to my Dog Breed Informational repository!** üê∂

The goal of this repository is to provide various machine learning methods for information on dogs, over 70 breeds! Types of models include a multi agent RAG application, an image classifier, a full RAG pipeline and a language model that has been fine tuned with specific facts about these breeds.

Head over to the [QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/chrismontes22/Dog-Classification/blob/main/QUICKSTART.md) to see them. Or check out the rest of my GitHub repository to see the scripts that further streamlined the data training processes of some of these models! üêï
