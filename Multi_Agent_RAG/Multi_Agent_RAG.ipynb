[Check out my other notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1by5UTMttZwW6xGGo89hmVNu2b90V3-HV#scrollTo=qpSPqD1AcNiH) that shows the full process, starting from gathering the text data to setting up a basic RAG, all in one go.\n",

The free tier offers 1000 API calls. Furthermore, the key in this notebook further down is stored and retrieved as a Colab Secret. If you are not using Google Colab, you will need to retrieve your API Key in a different manner, such as with dot_env or importing a config file (or directly if its for your eyes only).\n",
